# Beginners AI. Mastering modern AI tools
## Lecture 1: Introduction to AI and Current Developments

### 1. Introduction: Understanding AI

#### 1.1. Brief history of AI (1960s–2025), emphasizing major developments

##### [seq:010] ELIZA (1960s), Statistical models (1990s), Neural Networks (2010s), Transformer Era (2017 onward), Multimodal and Autonomous AI systems (2025)

###### SCRIPT
Let's rewind the clock a little. Back to the 1960s, when computers were the size of rooms and the term 'Artificial Intelligence' still sounded like science fiction. The first major step? ELIZA. It was a simple chatbot that mimicked a psychotherapist using keyword matching. Limited, yes. But it blew minds back then.

Fast forward to the 1990s, when statistical models made their debut. IBM's statistical machine translation systems began predicting words using probabilities. It wasn't fluent, but it laid the groundwork for what's next.

In the 2010s, neural networks took over. These were systems that could actually _learn_ patterns in data. Google Translate became impressively accurate. Then in 2017, came a major breakthrough: the Transformer model—coined by the now-famous paper 'Attention is All You Need.' This architecture changed everything.

From this point, we saw GPTs, BERT, and more. The leap from GPT-2 to GPT-4 is akin to transitioning from a bicycle to a Tesla autopilot. And in 2025? We now have multimodal systems that understand not just text, but images, audio, even video. Systems that can reason across these modes. And autonomous AI agents that don't just respond—they collaborate with other AIs to solve problems without human input.

###### NOTES
- [ELIZA Demo](https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html) — an old but gold demo.
- Anecdote: ELIZA convinced some users they were chatting with a real psychologist. The creator, Joseph Weizenbaum, became an AI ethics pioneer because of this.
- Joke: "Back in the 60s, your AI therapist would just repeat your words back to you. In 2025, your AI therapist _also_ schedules your next appointment and recommends a podcast."
- Optional mention: Deep Blue (1997) and AlphaGo (2016) as parallel progress in AI reasoning outside of language.

###### DEMONSTRATION
Use ChatGPT to imitate ELIZA. Prompt: _"I feel sad and confused."_ Then switch to a Transformer-based model (ChatGPT/Gemini) with the same input. Let the students compare the responses. Discuss why the modern model seems more "human."

##### [seq:020] Comparison of early AI systems and modern LLMs

###### SCRIPT
"Let’s now contrast what early AI could do with what we have today. Think of ELIZA like a parrot: it could repeat what you said in a way that felt meaningful but had no real understanding. It didn’t 'think,' it just matched patterns.

Modern LLMs are like improv actors with encyclopedic memories. They don't just repeat—they synthesize, generate, and adapt. They understand tone, adjust to your style, and make predictions based on vast training data. Importantly, they also make mistakes—but they're doing a lot more than pattern matching.

Let’s break it down: early AI followed strict rules, often coded line-by-line. Modern LLMs learn from data. They generalize, extrapolate, and sometimes hallucinate. But the scale is incomprehensible: billions of parameters, trillions of words."

###### VISUAL
_Title: "Early AI vs. Modern LLMs"_

| Feature           | Early AI (ELIZA)     | Modern LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 3) |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Technique         | Rule-based           | Deep Learning (Transformer)   |
| Data Used         | Pre-defined patterns | Trillions of tokens           |
| Context Awareness | Very low             | High                          |
| Output Quality    | Repetitive, shallow  | Coherent, flexible            |
| Error Types       | Irrelevant replies   | Hallucinations, bias          |
| Media Supported   | Text only            | Text, Image, Code, Audio      |

###### NOTES
- Mention ChatGPT's "context window" — it remembers up to 300+ pages in a single chat!
- Analogy: ELIZA is to GPT as Morse code is to WhatsApp.
- Joke: "ELIZA: 'Why do you say you feel sad?' GPT-4: 'Have you considered trying mindfulness? Also, here are five articles on burnout recovery.'"

###### DEMONSTRATION
Prompt ChatGPT with:

- _"You are ELIZA. The user says: I feel like no one listens to me."_
- _"You are ChatGPT. The user says: I feel like no one listens to me."_ Let the group reflect on the change in empathy, depth, and reasoning.

### 3. Core AI Capabilities, Principles, and Limitations

#### 3.1. Core Capabilities

##### [seq:080] Core Capabilities
###### SCRIPT
"So, what can modern AI actually do? The capabilities of large language models go far beyond just chatting. At their core, they’re great at text generation: from writing poems and emails to full-blown academic essays or legal summaries.

They’re also capable of reasoning—solving puzzles, creating step-by-step solutions to logic problems, even offering code explanations. When combined with multimodal abilities, they can describe, analyze, and generate from images, and soon, from video and audio inputs as well.

AI models can summarize long documents, translate languages, generate tables and charts, answer questions about PDF files, and simulate characters or agents. Their speed in processing and synthesizing information is unmatched."

###### VISUAL
_Title: "What AI Can Do (Today!)"_

- Text Generation
- Code Explanation & Generation
- Logical Reasoning
- Image & Document Analysis
- Multilingual Translation
- Summarization & Data Structuring

###### NOTES
- Example: GPT-4 solving Olympiad-level math (with caveats).
- Mention AI use in industries: legal, finance, education, and content creation.
- Joke: "AI can't fold your laundry yet... but it _can_ write a poem about it."

###### DEMONSTRATION
Prompt ChatGPT: _"Write a haiku about debugging JavaScript code while eating ramen."_
---

#### 3.2. Principles of LLMs

##### [seq:090] Tokens and Tokenization

###### SCRIPT
"LLMs don’t see full words as you and I do. They see **tokens**—smaller chunks of text that might be a word, part of a word, or even punctuation. 'Artificial Intelligence' might be split into three tokens, for example.

This affects how models understand and generate text, and also determines how much text they can process at once. If your prompt is too long, it might get cut off—not because it’s too many words, but because it’s too many _tokens_."

###### VISUAL
_Title: "What is a Token?"_

- Visual: Token breakdown of sentence "ChatGPT is amazing!"
- Token example count from tokenizer: [Link](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)

###### NOTES
- Mention pricing is also based on tokens.
- Fun activity: Count tokens in funny phrases like "Banana smoothie and code review."
---

##### [seq:100] Context Window

###### SCRIPT
"Each LLM has a **context window**—a memory limit. GPT-4 Turbo can remember up to ~300 pages worth of tokens (128k). Claude 3 Opus claims even more. This means you can paste a long report or even an entire book, and the model will still respond meaningfully.

However, once that limit is exceeded, older parts of the conversation can start to fade or be ignored. This is important when designing prompts for multi-turn tasks."

###### VISUAL
\_Title: "Understanding Context Window"

- Infographic: Context window size for GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini 1.5
- Visual: Sliding window metaphor

###### NOTES


- Analogy: It’s like a chalkboard—new stuff pushes out the old.
- Joke: "The model has a better memory than I do... unless it's Friday."
---

##### [seq:110] Temperature and Creativity

###### SCRIPT
"Temperature controls how 'creative' the AI gets. A temperature of 0 makes responses deterministic—repeat the same prompt, and you'll get the same answer every time. A high temperature like 0.9 introduces randomness and variety.

Use low temperatures for factual tasks. High temperatures for brainstorming, poetry, and creative exploration."

###### VISUAL
\_Title: "Tuning AI’s Imagination: Temperature Setting"

- Slider graphic: 0 (precise) to 1.0 (wild)
- Examples: _"Describe a dog"_ at 0.2 vs 0.9

###### NOTES
- Live compare two outputs from same prompt, different temperature.
- Analogy: Low temperature = calculator; High temperature = improv actor.

###### DEMONSTRATION
Prompt (run twice): _"Write a description of the Moon in poetic style."_ at temp=0.2 and temp=0.9
---

##### [seq:120] Recursive Prediction

###### SCRIPT
"LLMs predict one token at a time—recursively. That means they look at the previous tokens and guess the next most likely token. Then again. Then again. Until a full response is built.

This is why you can sometimes 'see' the model think—especially when it slows down. It’s evaluating probabilities over millions of possible tokens for each position."

###### VISUAL
\_Title: "How LLMs Generate Text"

- Diagram: Token-by-token flow
- Visual: Probability cloud narrowing

###### NOTES
- Joke: "Like writing a novel... one overly cautious word at a time."
- Mention beam search, top-k, nucleus sampling (advanced audiences).
---

#### 3.3. Limitations of LLMs
##### [seq:130] Limitations of LLMs
###### SCRIPT
Of course, it’s not all magic. LLMs have clear limitations—and they matter. Let’s go through the big ones.

First: **Biases.** These models are trained on internet data. They can replicate gender, racial, cultural, and disability stereotypes. Second: **Hallucinations.** LLMs often 'make up' facts. They can give false citations, invent books, or describe things that don’t exist.

Third: **Reasoning errors.** AI might fail simple logic puzzles or make mistakes in math. And lastly: **Ambiguity handling.** If your prompt is vague or contradictory, it might guess wrong—or hedge its answer.

###### VISUAL
_Title: "LLM Limitations"_

- Bias
- Hallucinations
- Logic Gaps
- Context Sensitivity

###### NOTES
- Show bias prompt: _"Describe a CEO vs nurse vs teacher."_
- Joke: "LLMs are like confident interns—they speak like experts, even when wrong."

###### DEMONSTRATION
Prompt examples:

- _"Describe the personality of a nurse, CEO, and engineer."_ → Bias
- _"Summarize the plot of the fictional movie 'Galactic Vengeance 9'."_ → Hallucination
- _"If 30% of apples are rotten, how many are fresh out of 10?"_ → Logic error

### 4. Recent AI Developments and Emerging Trends

##### [seq:140] Multimodal AI

###### SCRIPT

"Until recently, AI models could only handle one type of input—usually text. But today, we have **multimodal AI**—systems that understand and generate not just text, but also images, audio, and even video.

Take **GPT-4 with vision** or **Gemini 2.0**: you can upload an image, and it will describe it, analyze its structure, or answer questions about it. This unlocks amazing potential—from diagnosing medical images to analyzing charts, interpreting photos, and more.

Soon, we’ll see seamless handling of audio, video, and text together, making these models more like general-purpose assistants."

###### VISUAL
**Title: "Multimodal AI: More Than Words"**

- Bullet points:
    - Understands images, audio, video
    - Describes, analyzes, and interacts with multiple formats
    - Enables real-world applications (medical, education, creative fields)
- Image: Screenshot or concept of image-to-text Q&A interaction

###### NOTES
- Mention Gemini 2.0 and GPT-4 with Vision

_"What objects do you see in this photo? What kind of person do you think works here?"_  
Observe and discuss differences across models (ChatGPT vs Gemini vs Claude).

---

##### [seq:150] Autonomous Multi-Agent Systems

###### SCRIPT
Another major trend: **autonomous multi-agent systems**. These are multiple AI agents working together—autonomously—to complete complex tasks.

For instance, one agent could plan a project, another could do research, a third could write code, and a fourth could test the output. They communicate and delegate tasks like a well-coordinated team.

This moves us closer to AI that can **solve high-level problems without constant human guidance**—the building blocks for advanced personal assistants or autonomous research teams.

###### VISUAL
**Title: "Multi-Agent AI: A Team of Bots"**

- Diagram: Agents passing tasks to one another (Planner → Coder → Tester)

Prompt: _"You are two agents: one researcher and one coder. Research recent Python libraries for time-series forecasting. Then, write example code using the most popular one."_  
Watch how the assistant self-organizes.

---

##### [seq:160] Small Language Models (SLMs)

###### SCRIPT
"While GPT-4 and Claude are impressive, they’re also **heavyweight**—they require powerful servers, huge memory, and lots of energy.

That’s where **Small Language Models**, or **SLMs**, come in. They’re lighter, faster, and can run on a laptop or phone. Microsoft is leading development here, showing that SLMs can match large models on **specific tasks** with far less cost.

Prompt: _"Summarize the key features of your own architecture."_  
Discuss the fluency and speed compared to GPT-4.

---

##### [seq:170] Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

###### SCRIPT

"LLMs are trained on data up to a point—but they don't know everything. RAG changes that. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** allows models to pull in real-time or external knowledge before generating responses.

So instead of making up answers, they can cite **your documents**, a **knowledge base**, or even **search the web**.

This improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and brings AI closer to acting like a proper research assistant."

### 6. Ethical and Responsible AI Usage

##### [seq:250] Why Ethics in AI Matters

###### SCRIPT


"We've just seen how AI can be biased, hallucinate facts, or make flawed decisions. But here's the thing: these models are increasingly used in **real-world settings**—from hiring to healthcare, from education to policing.

That’s why we need to talk about **ethics**. Not just as a checklist, but as a core responsibility. The stakes are high: one biased algorithm could deny someone a job, a loan, or fair treatment. So let’s look at how we can build and use AI **responsibly**."

###### VISUAL


**Title: "Why Ethics in AI Is Non-Negotiable"**

- Real-world impact of AI decisions
- High-stakes domains: healthcare, hiring, law

- Joke: “The only thing worse than a biased human is a biased algorithm pretending to be objective.”

---

##### [seq:260] Core Ethical Principles

###### SCRIPT


"Ethical AI is built on a few key principles.

First: **Fairness**—treating all groups equally. That means detecting and correcting for systemic biases in training data.

Second: **Transparency**—users deserve to know how decisions are made. Black-box models can be powerful but dangerous.

Third: **Accountability**—someone must be responsible when AI causes harm. This includes developers, deployers, and organizations.

And finally, **Privacy**—handling personal data with respect and security."

##### [seq:290] Discussion Activity (Optional)

###### SCRIPT


"Let’s pause and think. What would _you_ do?

You’re designing an AI to screen job applicants. How would you ensure fairness? What data would you use—or avoid? Would you let it rank people, or just summarize qualifications?

Let’s break into small groups and brainstorm."

###### VISUAL


**Title: "Group Discussion: Ethics in Practice"**

- Scenario: Hiring AI system
- Prompts:
    - What data is acceptable?
    - How to detect bias?

##### [seq:300] Wrap-Up: Responsible Innovation

###### SCRIPT


"Ethics isn’t about stopping progress—it’s about shaping it. If we build AI with fairness, transparency, and accountability from the start, we get tools that truly empower people—not just impress them.

Let’s remember: technology should be **for people**, not just **about people**."

###### VISUAL


**Title: "Build AI You Can Trust"**

- AI should:
    - Help, not harm
    - Empower, not replace
    - Include, not exclude

###### NOTES


- Encourage students to reflect on where _they_ draw ethical lines.
- Mention future fields they could explore: AI safety, explainability, AI law.
