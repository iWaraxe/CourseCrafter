# Beginners AI. Mastering modern AI tools

## Lecture 3: Advanced Features and User Interfaces of Leading AI Tools

### 1. Introduction: Beyond Basics

#### 1.1. Course Context and Overview

##### [seq:010] Introduction

###### SCRIPT

"Welcome back, everyone! In our first lecture, we took a critical look at generative AI—what it can and can’t do. We saw examples of bias, hallucinations, and logical errors. Then, in Lecture 2, we flipped the script and explored practical uses: from writing and debugging code to translating idioms and analyzing visuals.

Today, we go a level deeper.

This session is all about the **advanced features and user interfaces** of leading AI tools. We’ll uncover what lies beneath the surface of ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and others—and show how you can use them more effectively and creatively.

Think of it as going from driving the car to popping the hood and learning how to fine-tune the engine. We’ll look at hidden UI tools, customizable assistants, token mechanics, advanced reasoning, and even how multi-agent systems work.

And yes—this is the lecture where things start to feel like science fiction. But everything I show you today is real, available, and in your hands to explore."

##### [seq:050] Underlying Principles of Advanced LLM Usage

###### SCRIPT

"So far, we’ve looked at what these tools _can do_ through their interfaces. Now, let’s peel back the curtain to understand _how_ they work.

There are four essential concepts that power every interaction you have with a language model:

1. **Tokens**
2. **Context Windows**
3. **Temperature Settings**
4. **Recursive Prediction**

Grasping these concepts will help you write smarter prompts, troubleshoot strange outputs, and fine-tune models for specific tasks."

###### VISUAL

**Slide Title: "How LLMs Think (And Why It Matters)"**

- Tokens = Model building blocks
- Context = Memory limit for input/output
- Temperature = Creativity control
- Recursive Prediction = Word-by-word construction

Visual: Infographic with each term illustrated

###### NOTES

### 3. Advanced Reasoning Capabilities

#### 3.1. Reasoning Frameworks

##### [seq:060] Demonstrations: Advanced Reasoning and Complex Tasks

###### SCRIPT

"Now let’s take a step into the deep end: reasoning.

AI is no longer just about grammar checks or generating headlines. Today’s models can tackle logic puzzles, simulate ethical decision-making, design experiments, and even imagine alien societies.

This section is a series of carefully chosen demonstrations—each meant to stress-test the model's reasoning ability in a different dimension: logic, math, ethics, science, society, creativity, and language.

As we go through these examples, ask yourself: What is the model _really_ doing well? Where does it start to break down? And how can we design better prompts to support its thinking?"
